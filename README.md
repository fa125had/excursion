Starting to learn Git and Github via pushing this landing page to the repository.
Also beside them, I'm starting to learn HTML and CSS, so I followed what I learned to make this project,
I still need to learn very much to make this reponsive maybe or write a better ReadMe file base on MarkDown, they are awesome.
